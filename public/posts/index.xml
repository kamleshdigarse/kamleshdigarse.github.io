      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, PostgreSQL has emerged as a powerful tool, transforming the way businesses and developers in India approach data management. This open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) offers a plethora of features that make it a preferred choice for many. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore how PostgreSQL is revolutionizing the tech scene in India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-cost-effectiveness&#34;&gt;1. Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant advantages of PostgreSQL is its cost-effectiveness. Being open-source, it eliminates the need for expensive licensing fees associated with proprietary databases. This is particularly beneficial for startups and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India, where budget constraints are often a major concern. By adopting PostgreSQL, businesses can allocate their resources more efficiently, investing in innovation and growth rather than hefty software costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
